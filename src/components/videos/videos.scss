//  <li>Build your media with accessibility in mind! It is much easier to work accessibility into the beginning than trying to tack it on later. This is true of all components, but especially for media components.</li>
//  <li>Make sure your player is accessible and includes control elements to pause, stop, and play your media.</li>
//  <li>Do not auto-play your media. This can cause confusion as well as annoyance.</li>
//  <li>Make sure your media has alternative methods to get to the content. For example, add captions to your videos and/or provide a transcript for your users to read.</li>
//  <li>Make sure your media does not cause seizures! Use the Photosensitive Epilepsy Analysis Tool (PEAT) to check your media before you add it to your website.</li>
// </ul>

// <blockquote>There are a ton of WCAG Guidelines for media on websites for a reason...there are a lot of factors to consider. Don't let that scare you though, there are also some easy wins. Just including some alternatives to the media you present (ex. transcript for a video) is half the battle.</blockquote>
